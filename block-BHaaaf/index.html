  <p class="para">Sometimes the decisions you make leads to the weirdest and memorable moments. So I had made the plans to go on trekking to Dalhousie but never knew there will be such twist and turns in this journey. It starts with me getting grumpy not feeling like going anywhere but ended up boarding the train at Bombay central without the tickets. That’s right I didn’t have the confirm tickets so I decided to board the train on general tickets. Seriously!!</p>
  <p class="para">You can imagine the kind of things I have to put up with but that’s not true !!! I After TC arrivals and all that ruckus I got half seat with another playgroup that’s going to Pathankot: the nearest railway station to Dalhousie. Can you believe that!! This journey gave me the best feel for humanity ever.  I reached Chakki bank, a small station just outside Pathankot, surviving the chilly winter nights of Punjab.   Here on I had no clue from where will I find the bus to Dalhousie, how will I reach there, how long will it take? Luckily I met one family which drove me to the bus stop from where I can board the bus.</p>
  <p class="para">After waiting a while and going through mixed emotions like kid steps out of the house for the first time, the bus came. Punjab road transport, I could never have been happier in my life when I actually saw Punjab written all over it. It was one of my many dreams to be in Punjab, all thanks to Bollywood movies !! :p The bus took almost 3hrs to reach Dalhousie its approx 80km from Pathankot. It was almost dark outside by the time I reached my base camp. After spending crazy two days travelling I was all drained out, only to be woken up at 5 am the next morning to be welcomed by the mighty Dhauladhar range sparkling in the first ray of sunrise. That moment you realize how beautiful is this planet earth and how small your life is.</p>
